%%% 1. Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
	\item Reason for making a literature review: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
		\item Creating or choosing a system that is 'good' for an entire society is challenging due to: plurality of the population (multiple sets of values that might be conflicting), non-utilitarian factors also play a role in determining whether the system is 'good', difficulty of identifying what individuals consider to be good. {\itshape(example smart grids)}
		\item Insights from a wide variety of different fields may however be used to tackle this challenge. Therefore, it is useful to get a clear overview of the state of research by grouping the work done in different fields. In particular, we identify opportunities in the application of quantitative tools (e.g. Agent-based modeling), which we believe will provide us with new useful insights.
		\item Also, we did not found any comparable and complete literature review yet.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Goal of this article: present the outcomes of a literature review about the state of research in the creation of value robust systems.
	\item Methods:
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
		\item Online databases: Scopus, Web of Science
		\item The following query is used: (TITLE-ABS-KEY("social choice") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY("societal trade-off*") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(Arrow's theorem)) AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY(multi*) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(many)) AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY(objective) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(criter*))
		\item {\itshape(Present here the process gone through during this literature review)}

\end{itemize}

%%% 2. Social choice
\section{Social choice}
\label{Social choice}

\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
	\item What is social choice ({\itshape In our context broader that only social choice theory})?
	\item In which context are they relevant? Why is making a `perfect' social decision challenging/impossible ? 
	\item A dynamic perspective: dynamic topic modeling of the semantic of `social choice' in the literature.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results and analysis}
\label{Results and analysis}

\subsection{Overview of the results}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
	\item Co-authors networks
	\item Citation networks
	\item Others?
\end{enumerate}

Why needed?
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
	\item Garner: the use of a traditional Integrated Assessment Model (IAMs), which typically aggregate the stakeholders' preferences across the entire globe into a single a priori defined utility function (to optimize it), eliminates many relevant policy pathways.
	\item
\end{itemize}

Why challenging?
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
	\item Munda: Says that difficulty is due to social and technical incommensurability
	\item
\end{itemize}
	
\noindent Approaches proposed:	
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
	\item Munda: Proposes the concept of social multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE). Based on the work of Arrow \& Raynaud (1986), which "showed that the relationships between multi-criteria decision theory and social choice are clear and relevant". Says that public participation is recognized as a necessary component, but not sufficient.
	\item Buckley: proposes a fuzzy set approach. A group of judges identifies `How well each issue satisfies each criterion' and `How important each criterion is to the overall objective'. The aggregation process than has the following properties:(1) positive association of individual and group preference, (2) Pareto, (3) no judge or criterion can be dictatorial, (4) independence of irrelevant alternatives, (5) citizen's sovereignty. 
	\item Blackorby: Proposes the concept of â€˜critical-level utilitarianism'. This is done by setting a minimal degree of utilitarianism that individuals in a group should achieve. The goal is then to maximize the amount of well-being of the population that are (more) above the critical level.
	\item Van de Poel (2015): identifies 6 methods to deal with value conflicts, with related advantages and inconveniences: Cost-Benefit Analysis, Direct Trade-Offs, Maximin, Satisficing, Judgment: Conceptualization and (Re)specification, Innovation.
	\item Franssen (2005): Applies Arrow's theorem to multi-criteria problems, as a social-choice problem
	\item Kasprzyk \& Reed (2015): introduces Many-objective planning, which disaggregate measures of performance while supporting the discovery of planning trade-offs, using tools such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs)
\end{itemize}
	
\section{Conclusions and next steps}
\label{Conclusions and next steps}

\begin{itemize}
	\item We conclude this article by concretely identifying opportunities to evaluate the acceptability of large infrastructures, and the research that should be done for that purpose.
